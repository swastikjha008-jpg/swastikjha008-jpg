# Hey, I'm Swastik 👋  

💻 A student exploring the world of coding and creating cool stuff along the way.  
🚀 Currently learning and building projects in **C++**, but always curious to try new things.  
🎯 My goal: improve every day — one project, one bug fix at a time.  
🧩 I love solving problems, experimenting with ideas, and watching them come to life through code.  
☕ When I’m not coding, I’m probably thinking about my next project.
